# Introduction #

The original code for this project was hosted on the Adobe Labs SVN server.  It is still available should you need it.

**Note:**  These instructions are only for accessing the **old** version of this library.  As of January 2007, the library has moved to a Google Code subversion repository located at http://as3flickrlib.googlecode.com/svn/.

# Details #

  * To view the repository in a web browser, navigate to: http://labs.adobe.com/svn/flashplatform/?/projects/flickr/

  * To checkout the code, use "svn checkout http://labs.adobe.com/subversion/flashplatform/projects/flickr"

  * If you insist on using the source code browser, when you find a class that you want, click on the "text" link rather than the class name to get a text version. The text version preserves the original formatting and doesn't add line numbers.
